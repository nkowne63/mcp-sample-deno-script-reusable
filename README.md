# mcp-sample-deno-script-reusable

This is a sample implementation of a simple Deno script that fulfills the following three requirements within a single file:

- runs as an executable script, operating as an MCP server via standard input/output.
- includes tests.
- can be imported from other files without causing side effects like starting the MCP server upon import.
